Breakpoint
==========

Heatmaps for sound. Server stuff still heavily in progress, so those working on JS stuff, stick to opening the html files with your browser rather than navigating there through the server.

##Setup
    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    pip install Flask
    pip install Flask-OAuth

##Usage
    python app.py

Storyboarding
-------------
*open app/webpage
*modal dialogue comes up: "login with facebook/github/etc" if you would like to upload a sound bite (so we can attach bites to users if they choose to not be anonymous)
*on exit/login, the map with soundheatmapoverlay is visible
